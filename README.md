# Context
Research Summer Camp (RSC) is a set research projects made within School of AI Algiers club [SOAI LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/school-of-ai-algiers/) that included different research topics, this notebook includes the implemntation been done on **Automatic Curriculum Learning (AutoCL) for Hard Exploration Environments**

# Automatic Curriculum Learning (AutoCL)
AutoCL is a technique used within Reinforcement Learning applications especially while tackling hard exploration environments that raise certain difficulties for RL algorithms to learn from scratch.

# Rubik's Cube
The environment that has been chosen to conduct our research and implemntation upon is Rubik's cube. The latter offers the challenge of solving a sparse reward problem, which means that the agent will only receive a reward of 1 when the cube is solved and 0 otherwise. This makes the learning process very hard and time consuming. We used the [Rubik's Cube Jumanji Environment](https://instadeepai.github.io/jumanji/environments/rubiks_cube/)
